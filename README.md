# Comparison of LLM Models for Data Retrieval from Static Pages Using RAG Architecture

## Objective

This work aims to present a comparative analysis of data retrieval from static pages using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The study seeks to understand the nuances and challenges involved in choosing the most effective model for this task, highlighting the importance of robust and standardized evaluation methods.
