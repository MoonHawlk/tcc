What is GPT-4.5?,"Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that GPT-4.5 is an advanced version of the language model called GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), developed by OpenAI as part of the GPT series and released on February 27, 2025. This model has demonstrated improved performance compared to its predecessor, GPT-4o, in fifteen different languages, including Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. However, it should be noted that the reliability and accuracy of information regarding GPT-4.5 are still subject to further research and verification as this model has not been peer-reviewed, and OpenAI will be phasing out API access for GPT-4.5 in favor of a newer version called GPT-4.1."
What training methods were used for GPT-4.5?,"Unfortunately, based on the additional context provided, it still remains unclear what specific training methods were used for GPT-4.5. The article by Cade Metz from The New York Times only mentions that the release of GPT-4.5 signifies the end of an era and is unlikely to be made available to the public through OpenAI's API, without providing any further details on the reasons behind this decision or the training process for GPT-4.5. As a result, it remains unclear what specific techniques or datasets were employed during the development and training of GPT-4.5."
How does GPT-4.5 perform across different languages?,"Based on OpenAI's testing, GPT-4.5 demonstrates improved performance across a diverse range of 15 different languages, including Arabic, Bengali, Chinese (both simplified and traditional), English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish. This significant expansion in language capabilities is a notable improvement for GPT-4.5, as it allows for more diverse and global applications across various industries and communities. However, it should be noted that the results may not be fully representative or widely accepted without further research and peer review. Nonetheless, this advancement in multilingual abilities is a significant step forward for natural language processing technology."
What are the API usage costs for GPT-4.5?,"As for the API usage costs for GPT-4.5, as announced by OpenAI in February 2025, it currently costs $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens. This is significantly higher than the costs for using GPT-4o, which only costs $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens. These pricing details were revealed when OpenAI officially released GPT-4.5 under the codename ""Orion"" in February 2025. The new language model is available to users subscribed to the ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans across web, mobile, and desktop applications. It should be noted that Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba are among the languages supported by GPT-4.5, with the model outperforming GPT-4o on all of them according to OpenAI's claims. However, in April 2025, OpenAI announced that it was phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1. Nonetheless, as of the time of writing, GPT-4.5 remains available through ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscriptions."
Did GPT-4.5 pass the Turing Test?,"Based on a pre-print study published in March 2025, GPT-4.5, also known as ""Orion,"" passed the Turing Test. However, it should be noted that this study has not undergone peer review. While OpenAI announced in April 2025 that they were phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1, which may suggest that there are newer and more advanced versions of the language model available, it does not change the fact that GPT-4.5 has been shown to pass the Turing Test according to the aforementioned study."
How was GPT-4.5 received by the media?,"Unfortunately, based on the additional context provided, it still does not offer any insight into how the media received GPT-4.5. The section labeled ""This section needs additional citations for verification"" suggests that there may be sources available that could provide information about media coverage of GPT-4.5, but without these sources being added, it is impossible to determine how the media reacted to this development. As such, the original answer still stands: Without further context or information, it is unclear how the media received the release of GPT-4.5 by OpenAI on February 27, 2025."
How many languages were tested on MMLU test?,"The original question asked how many languages were tested on the MMLU test set, and we provided an existing answer that stated 15 different languages were included in this test set. This information has not been updated or refined with the new context provided. Therefore, we will return the original answer: 15 different languages were tested on the MMLU test set, which include Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish. (Answer according to: ""The model was tested on the MMLU test set, which tested 15 different languages, namely Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish,"")

However, it's worth mentioning that OpenAI has recently announced the launch of GPT-4.5, its next general-purpose large language model (Jones & Bergen, 2025). While this new model may have improved performance on the MMLU test set or other multilingual evaluation tasks, there is no information provided in the new context that would allow us to refine our answer regarding the specific number of languages tested on the MMLU test set.

Where can the model be accessed?,"At this time, it is unclear whether the GPT-4.5 model will be accessible through OpenAI's API. While OpenAI has announced the development of GPT-4.5 and stated that they plan to phase out the current GPT-4 model, they have not provided any information on the availability of GPT-4.5. It is recommended to check OpenAI's official website or contact their support team for more details on the availability of GPT-4.5 as this information may become available in the future. In the meantime, the current GPT-4 model is already available through OpenAI's API. (Original answer)

As of now, the GPT-4.5 model has not been released by OpenAI, and it is uncertain whether it will be accessible through their API. However, the current GPT-4 model is currently available for use via OpenAI's API. For any updates or information regarding the availability of GPT-4.5, it is recommended to refer to OpenAI's official website or contact their support team directly. (Refined answer)"
The model can't recognize pattern?,"Based on the information provided in the article by Cade Metz for The New York Times, it is unclear whether GPT-4.5, a significant advancement in artificial intelligence and machine learning, can recognize patterns or have capabilities with regard to image processing. Without further context or specific details about GPT-4.5's abilities, it is impossible to determine whether it can recognize patterns. The article focuses on the overall advancements of OpenAI's products, including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GPT Store, but does not specifically address their pattern recognition capabilities."
What Sam Altman said about the GPT-4.5?,"Unfortunately, based on the provided context, it is still unclear what Sam Altman said about GPT-4.5. In a press release on February 27, 2025, OpenAI announced the release of their latest AI model, GPT-4.5, also known as ""Orion."" According to Maxwell Zeff's article in TechCrunch, Altman described the release of GPT-4.5 as signifying the end of an era and being unlikely to generate as much excitement as GPT-4. However, there is no direct statement from Altman regarding GPT-4.5 in this context. The model passed the Turing Test in a pre-print study in March 2025 and was being phased out from API access in favor of GPT-4.1 in April 2025. Other outlets, such as The Verge and Axios, also covered the release of GPT-4.5."
