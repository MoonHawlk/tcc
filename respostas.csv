Which is the largest city in Brazil by population?," Based on the provided context, São Paulo remains the largest city in Brazil by population, with a population of approximately 21.1 million inhabitants. It is also one of the most densely populated cities in Brazil, with a population density of about 57.8/sq mi. The census data indicates that the population is heavily concentrated in the Southeast region, where Brazil's most populous city, São Paulo, is located. This region also hosts the capital, Brasília. Brazil, being the largest country in South America and the fifth-largest in the world by area, has over 212 million people, with its other major cities including Rio de Janeiro. Brazil is a federation composed of 26 states and a Federal District, and Portuguese is its official language, making it the country with the most Portuguese speakers in the world."
When did Brazil gain independence from Portugal?," Brazil gained independence from Portugal on September 7, 1822, when Prince Pedro I, a member of the Portuguese royal family, declared the country's independence and established the Empire of Brazil. This event marked the culmination of a long struggle for independence that had been brewing since the early 19th century. The Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the Cisplatina province. The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on March 8, 1824; however, Portugal officially recognized Brazilian independence on August 29, 1825. It's important to note that Pedro I was the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil. The years following independence were marked by administrative turmoil and political dissent, which eventually led to Pedro I abdicating in 1831."
What are Brazil’s borders?," Based on the provided context, Brazil shares its land borders with Uruguay to the south, Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest, Bolivia and Peru to the west, Colombia to the northwest, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north. It also has a significant coastline along the eastern side of South America, specifically by the Atlantic Ocean, with a length of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi). Covering roughly half of South America's land area, it borders all other countries and territories on the continent except Ecuador and Chile. Brazil encompasses a wide range of tropical and subtropical landscapes, as well as wetlands, savannas, plateaus, and low mountains. It contains most of the Amazon basin, including the world’s largest river system and most extensive virgin tropical forest. Brazil's territory includes several oceanic archipelagos such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, and the islands of Trindade and Martim Vaz. Its geographical diversity is highlighted by its size, relief, climate, and natural resources."
What is the Amazon Rainforest known for?," The Amazon Rainforest is renowned for its immense biodiversity, housing an extraordinary variety of plant, animal, and insect species. It is also the world's largest tropical rainforest and river basin, with the Amazon River being its most prominent feature. This vast ecosystem plays a crucial role in the global climate by absorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.

However, it's important to note that extensive legal and illegal logging destroy forests the size of a small country per year, posing a threat to the diverse species that inhabit this region through habitat destruction and fragmentation. Since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers (230,000 sq mi) of the Amazon rainforest have been cleared by logging.

As of 2017, preserved native vegetation occupied 61% of the Brazilian territory, while agriculture occupied only 8% and pastures 19.7%. This highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve this vital ecosystem, which not only provides essential habitat for numerous indigenous tribes but also contributes to the cultural richness of several countries, particularly Brazil. Economically, it contributes through resources such as timber, rubber, and minerals, although its preservation is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and sustaining local communities. The information provided here is based on reliable sources from June 2008, including Encarta, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and IUCN Green List."

What is the dominant religion in Brazil?," Given the additional context provided, it appears that the religious landscape in Brazil is characterized by a rich diversity, with syncretistic practices within the Catholic Church and a significant Protestant community. While Roman Catholicism remains the dominant religion with an estimated 64.6% of the population (as per the 2010 census), Protestantism plays a substantial role, accounting for approximately 22.2% of the population. This growth can be attributed to a combination of American missionary influence and government policies during the 20th century. The most common Protestant denominations are Evangelical Pentecostal ones, although there are other denominations as well. It's important to note that these numbers might have changed since the 2010 census, but they still provide a useful context for understanding the religious composition in Brazil.
