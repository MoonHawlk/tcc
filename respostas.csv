What is DeepSeek?,"DeepSeek is a Chinese AI startup that was prohibited on U.S. government devices in 2025 due to concerns about disclosing proprietary information with the Chinese Communist Party. After the ban, DeepSeek continued to operate and could be accessed through its web version. However, this led to further scrutiny as South Korea's Personal Information Protection Commission opened an inquiry into DeepSeek's use of personal information, while the Dutch Data Protection Authority and Taiwan's digital ministry also launched investigations. Additionally, Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a state ban on using DeepSeek services to prevent information security risks.
