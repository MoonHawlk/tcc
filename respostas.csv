How does GPT-4.5 perform across different languages?,"According to the provided context information, GPT-4.5 outperforms GPT-4o on all language models including Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. This suggests that GPT-4.5 has a strong ability to understand and generate text in various languages.

GPT-4.5 is a large language model developed by OpenAI as part of the GPT series. It was officially released on February 27, 2025, and is available to users subscribed to the ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans across web, mobile, and other platforms. The model supports 15 different languages, including Arabic, Spanish, French, Korean, Hebrew, Hungarian, Japanese, Turkish, and Chinese.

The performance of GPT-4.5 across these languages indicates its versatility and effectiveness in understanding and generating text in various linguistic contexts.

Additionally, GPT-4.5 was tested on the MMLU test set, which evaluated its performance in 15 different languages such as Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. The results showed that GPT-4.5 outperformed GPT-4o in all these languages, further highlighting its strong language understanding capabilities.

Overall, the performance of GPT-4.5 across different languages demonstrates its potential as a versatile and effective language model for various applications."
What are the API usage costs for GPT-4.5?,"As of February 2025, through OpenAI's API it costs $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens for GPT-4.5. However, note that in April 2025, OpenAI announced that they are phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1."
Did GPT-4.5 pass the Turing Test?,"Yes, according to the pre-print study in March 2025, GPT-4.5 passed the Turing Test."
How was GPT-4.5 received by the media?,"Based on the provided context information, it is mentioned that in April 2025, OpenAI announced that they were phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1. However, there is no specific mention about how GPT-4.5 was received by the media.

The additional context provided states that Cade Metz, writing for The New York Times, stated that the model ""signifies the end of an era"" and was ""unlikely to be missed."" This suggests that while GPT-4.5 may have been a significant development in AI technology, its impact on the media landscape was not particularly substantial or memorable.

Therefore, based on this information, it can be inferred that GPT-4.5 received mixed reviews from the media, with some acknowledging its significance but also noting its limited impact."
How many languages were tested on MMLU test?,The MMLU test set tested 15 different languages.
Where can the model be accessed?,"Based on the provided context information and additional details, it seems that OpenAI has a GPT-4.5 AI model available for use through their API. However, there is no specific mention of where exactly this model can be accessed or if it requires any special permissions to access it. It would be best to check OpenAI's official website or contact them directly for more information on how to access the GPT-4.5 model.

Additionally, according to Cade Metz from The New York Times, the model signifies the end of an era and is unlikely to be available in other sources besides OpenAI's platform."
The model can't recognize pattern?,"The models mentioned in the context information are designed to recognize patterns. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), transformer models like Vision Transformer (ViT) and differentiable neural computers are all used for recognizing patterns in data.

However, if there is a specific issue with the model not being able to recognize patterns, it could be due to various factors such as insufficient training data, incorrect model architecture, or noise in the input data. In such cases, further investigation and optimization of the model may be required to improve its pattern recognition capabilities.

In addition, the context provided suggests that OpenAI has developed several advanced models for recognizing patterns, including GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and others. These models have been used in various applications such as chatbots, search engines, and generative art. If there is a specific issue with one of these models not being able to recognize patterns, it may be worth exploring the model's training data, architecture, or input data to identify potential issues."
What Sam Altman said about the GPT-4.5?,"According to Cade Metz from The New York Times, Sam Altman stated that the model signifies the end of an era and is unlikely to generate as much excitement as GPT-4. Additionally, a pre-print study in March 2025 found that GPT-4.5 passed the Turing Test, and OpenAI announced in April 2025 that it was phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1.
