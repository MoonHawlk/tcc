What is DeepSeek?,"DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup that has gained significant attention in the tech industry for its advanced AI technologies. However, due to national security concerns, the U.S. Department of Commerce prohibited the use of DeepSeek on government devices in 2025. This restriction also extends to other countries, as South Korea's Personal Information Protection Commission opened an inquiry into DeepSeek's use of personal information, and Taiwan's digital ministry advised its government departments against using the DeepSeek service due to information security risks. The Dutch Data Protection Authority has also launched an investigation of DeepSeek. These restrictions have been put in place due to concerns about disclosing proprietary information to the Chinese Communist Party. This news comes after DeepSeek's AI dethroned ChatGPT on the App Store, causing a slump in stocks for companies like Nvidia and other related entities."
When was DeepSeek released?,"Based on the additional sources provided, it is still unclear when DeepSeek was released as none of the articles explicitly state a release date. However, the article by Tweedie and Altchek (2025) mentions that DeepSeek temporarily limited new sign-ups due to ""large-scale malicious attacks,"" which suggests that it may already be in use or widely available. The other articles by Kimery (2025), Shen (2025), and Booth and Hornby (both 2025) also refer to DeepSeek as an established AI system, further implying that it has been released prior to their publication dates. Therefore, we can infer that DeepSeek was likely released before April 6, 2025, the date of Shen's article. However, without further information, the exact release date of DeepSeek remains uncertain."
What nickname has been given to DeepSeek's release in the context of AI competition?,"Based on the additional context provided, it appears that ""DeepSeek Open Source Week"" has been nicknamed as a competition in the AI industry. This event, which kicked off on February 24, 2025, includes the release of DeepSeek's open-source codebase on GitHub, and is being compared to an AI space race or AI brinkmanship due to its potential impact on the industry. However, it should be noted that the original question asked about a nickname for DeepSeek's release specifically, rather than for this event as a whole. As there is no direct reference in the text to a specific nickname for DeepSeek's release, we must return the original answer."
On which platforms is DeepSeek available?,"Based on recent reports, it has been revealed that DeepSeek, a popular AI app, was found to be sending user data from both the United States and South Korea to Chinese tech giant ByteDance, which is owned by the Chinese Communist Party. As a result, the use of DeepSeek was prohibited on U.S. Government devices in 2025 due to concerns about disclosing proprietary information to the Chinese government. It is unclear whether DeepSeek was available on any specific platforms prior to this ban, as the original context provided did not include this information. Without further clarification, it cannot be determined if DeepSeek is currently available on any specific platforms."
What type of license does DeepSeek use?,"Based on recent developments, it appears that DeepSeek may not operate under an open-source license due to concerns over disclosing proprietary information with the Chinese Communist Party and potential export control restrictions. While further research is necessary to confirm the specific licensing terms of DeepSeek, several governments have taken action against the app, including bans on government-issued devices in Texas, New South Wales, Australia, South Korea, Canada, and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Additionally, security researchers have found that DeepSeek sends data to a cloud platform affiliated with ByteDance, raising concerns over user privacy and potential misuse of personal information. These actions suggest that DeepSeek may operate under a non-open source license and potentially face export control restrictions due to national security and intellectual property protection concerns."
What hardware was used to train DeepSeek-V3?,"DeepSeek-V3 was trained using approximately 2,000 Nvidia H800 series chips, which are GPUs. This is significantly fewer resources compared to some competing services that use up to 16,000 GPUs for their chatbot training. However, it should be noted that in 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce prohibited DeepSeek on their government devices due to concerns about disclosing proprietary information with the Chinese Communist Party. This restriction may impact the availability and usage of DeepSeek-V3 in certain contexts, particularly in government and related sectors."
How long did it take to train DeepSeek-V3 and what was the cost?,"Based on recent reports and publications, it has been confirmed that DeepSeek-V3 was trained in approximately 55 days and the cost of training was US$5.58 million, as reported by South China Morning Post on April 6, 2025, and further mentioned in a research paper titled ""Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling"" published on arXiv on April 3, 2025. This information has not been disputed or refuted by any other sources, and therefore, we can confidently say that the original answer is still accurate and there is no need to refine it further."
What significant event occurred on January 27 2025 related to DeepSeek?,"On January 27, 2025, China's DeepSeek AI surpassed ChatGPT in downloads on the App Store, raising concerns about security and privacy risks as reported by cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs on February 6. This news led to a slump in Nvidia and other stocks, according to CBS News. Additionally, DeepSeek announced its plans to raise outside funding for the first time, with interest from Alibaba and Chinese state funds, as reported by Reuters on February 20. These developments shed light on the growing influence of DeepSeek in the AI industry and raised questions about its impact on data privacy and security."
What measures did DeepSeek take following a cyberattack on January 27 2025?,"Following a cyberattack on January 27, 2025, DeepSeek temporarily limited new sign-ups citing ""large-scale malicious attacks"" as reported by Tweedie and Altchek in their article for Business Insider. This measure was taken to ensure the security and integrity of user data and prevent further damage from the attack. The company has not provided any further details regarding the nature or extent of the cyberattack, but it has been noted that the incident caused a slump in the stocks of companies such as Nvidia and other related entities. DeepSeek's popularity had also surged after it overtook ChatGPT on the App Store, as reported by Field in his article for CNBC. However, this achievement was overshadowed by the cyberattack and its aftermath. Picchi's article for CBS News shed light on the reasons behind the stock slump, highlighting the potential impact of DeepSeek's success on the market share of other companies in the AI industry. This news comes at a time when leaders such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman have expressed differing opinions on DeepSeek's disruption, as reported by Sharma for Fortune India. Meanwhile, Johnson's criticism of China's A.I. Advances has also sparked debate in the industry, as reported by Karaian and Rennison for The New York Times."
What collaboration did DeepSeek engage in on April 3 2025?,"Unfortunately, based on the provided context information, there is still no mention of a collaboration that DeepSeek engaged in on April 3, 2025. The sources cited only provide information up to February and January of that year. It's possible that there was a collaboration on that date, but it has not been provided in the context given."
