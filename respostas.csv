When was DeepSeek released?," Based on the provided articles, it can be inferred that DeepSeek was released by January 27, 2025, as reported by Business Insider on that date. However, due to a ""large-scale malicious attack"" on the platform, new sign-ups were temporarily limited on the same day (as reported by The Guardian on January 28, 2025)."
What nickname has been given to DeepSeek's release in the context of AI competition?," In the provided context, it appears that DeepSeek has been referred to as a ""challenger"" or a ""disruptor"" in the emerging global AI space race, competing against Silicon Valley giants. This is not an official nickname but rather a description given by sources in the article and news reports. Additionally, it's also worth noting that DeepSeek has been described as a ""wake-up call"" by some leaders in the AI field, while others such as Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei, and Elon Musk have expressed skepticism about its performance or the sustainability of its success."

What hardware was used to train DeepSeek-V3?," The hardware used to train DeepSeek-V3 was Nvidia's H800 series chips, prior to the U.S. Department of Commerce's prohibition on its use in government devices due to concerns about proprietary information disclosure with the Chinese Communist Party in 2025. The information is based on articles published on January 26th and 28th, 2025 by Biometric Update, The Guardian, and LaptopMag."
How long did it take to train DeepSeek-V3 and what was the cost?," The training time for DeepSeek-V3 was approximately 55 days, as reported in the study ""Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling"" by Liu et al., published on April 3, 2025 (Liu et al., 2025). The cost of training DeepSeek-V3 was approximately US$5.58 million, as mentioned in the TechCrunch article by Wiggers dated April 30, 2025 (Wiggers, 2025). However, it's important to note that these figures have been questioned by Elon Musk, who suggested that DeepSeek may be utilizing massive Nvidia GPU infrastructure (Dhawan, 2025).
