What is DeepSeek?,"Based on the additional context, I will refine the original answer.

The refined answer is:

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI-related entity that offers a service or platform, which has raised concerns about its use of personal information and data protection.

This revised answer takes into account the new information that DeepSeek is not just an AI start-up company, but also a service or platform that has raised regulatory concerns about its handling of user data."
When was DeepSeek released?,"Unfortunately, I don't see any specific mention of when DeepSeek was released. The articles seem to be discussing its impact on the market (Nvidia stocks) and its ranking on the App Store, but they don't provide a clear release date.

However, it is mentioned that DeepSeek was discussed or reported on January 27, 2025, suggesting that it may have been available for some time prior to this date."
What nickname has been given to DeepSeek's release in the context of AI competition?,"The nickname given to DeepSeek's release is ""the first shot"" or more specifically, ""the first shot at what is emerging as a global AI space race""."
On which platforms is DeepSeek available?,"The text does not explicitly mention on which platforms DeepSeek is available. However, it mentions that DeepSeek is an ""AI app"" and has a GitHub codebase, suggesting that it may be available as open-source software that can be run on various platforms, but the specific platforms are not mentioned.

Given the new context, we can infer that DeepSeek was prohibited by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2025 due to security concerns, implying that it is likely available for use on devices that are not government-issued or restricted. Additionally, news articles mention that DeepSeek sent user data from South Korea and the US to China's ByteDance, suggesting that it may be available for download on various platforms, but this does not provide specific information about its availability.

Therefore, the refined answer remains: The text does not explicitly mention on which platforms DeepSeek is available."
What type of license does DeepSeek use?,"The refined answer remains the same as the original one:

""The text doesn't explicitly mention the type of license used by DeepSeek. However, it is mentioned that DeepSeek is ""free and open-source software"". This suggests that DeepSeek uses an open-source license, but the specific type of license is not specified.""

The additional context provided does not offer any new information about the type of license used by DeepSeek. It discusses security concerns, funding, and data release plans, but none of these details relate to the licensing of the software."
What hardware was used to train DeepSeek-V3?,"The refined answer remains:

* 2,000 Nvidia H800 series graphics processing units (GPUs)

The additional context provides news articles and opinions about DeepSeek-V3's capabilities and potential threats, but it does not provide any new or conflicting information about the hardware used for training DeepSeek-V3. Therefore, the original answer is still accurate and relevant to the question of what hardware was used to train DeepSeek-V3."
How long did it take to train DeepSeek-V3 and what was the cost?,"The original answer remains accurate: it took approximately 55 days to train DeepSeek-V3, and the cost was around $5.58 million.

The additional context provided does not mention any information about the training time or cost of DeepSeek-V3, but rather discusses upgrades to a different AI model called Prover. Therefore, no refinement is necessary."
What significant event occurred on January 27 2025 related to DeepSeek?,"With the additional context provided, I can refine the original answer.

According to the New York Times article dated January 27, 2025, China's A.I. advances are reported to have spooked Big Tech investors on Wall Street. This event is related to DeepSeek, indicating that its development or disruption has significant implications for the tech industry and investors.

Therefore, the refined answer is:

A significant event occurred on January 27, 2025, related to DeepSeek: China's A.I. advances spooked Big Tech investors on Wall Street."
What measures did DeepSeek take following a cyberattack on January 27 2025?,"The original answer was:

According to the provided text, after being hit with a ""large-scale"" cyber-attack, DeepSeek temporarily limited new sign-ups.

After reviewing the additional context, I can confirm that this answer is still accurate and relevant. The additional sources provide more information about the cyberattack on January 27, 2025, but they do not add any new details about the measures taken by DeepSeek in response to the attack. Therefore, the refined answer remains:

According to the provided text, following a ""large-scale"" cyber-attack on January 27, 2025, DeepSeek took measures to temporarily limit new sign-ups."
What collaboration did DeepSeek engage in on April 3 2025?,"The provided text does not mention a specific collaboration that DeepSeek engaged in on April 3, 2025. The dates mentioned are January 6, 27, and February 4, 2025, but there is no information about an event or collaboration on April 3, 2025.

However, I can note that the context provided does mention several articles from January 2025 discussing DeepSeek's performance and impact on the market. But none of these articles provide any information about a specific collaboration on April 3, 2025."
