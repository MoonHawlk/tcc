This training method is different from supervised learning, where labeled data is used to train the model to make specific predictions or classifications.

In addition to unsupervised learning, GPT-4.5 also underwent supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Supervised fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model like GPT-3 and further training it on a smaller, labeled dataset specific to a particular task or domain. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, involves presenting the model with a series of inputs and rewards or punishments based on its responses, which helps it learn how to make better decisions over time.
