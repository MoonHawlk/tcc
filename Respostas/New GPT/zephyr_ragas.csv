This new iteration, codenamed Orion, was introduced on February 27, 2025, and has demonstrated superior performance compared to its predecessor, GPT-4o, in understanding and generating text in Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba languages. Some experts suggest that this breakthrough may indicate that GPT-4.5 has passed the Turing Test, a significant milestone in artificial intelligence research. However, it should be noted that these claims are based on a pre-print study, and further investigation and analysis are required to fully understand the model's performance and potential applications. The announcement of GPT-4.5 has generated excitement in the AI community as it signifies a significant advancement in natural language processing capabilities.",1.0,0.7646252029710309

Training was conducted on Microsoft Azure.[3]']", "Based on the additional context provided, it appears that GPT-4.5 was primarily trained using unsupervised learning techniques, which involve feeding large amounts of unlabeled text data into the model to help it learn patterns and relationships in the language. This training method is different from supervised learning, where labeled data is used to train the model to make specific predictions or classifications.<br><br>In addition to unsupervised learning, GPT-4.5 also underwent supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Supervised fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model like GPT-3 and further training it on a smaller, labeled dataset specific to a particular task or domain. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, involves presenting the model with a series of inputs and rewards or punishments based on its responses, which helps it learn how to make better decisions over time.<br><br>The context also mentions that GPT-4.5 was trained using Microsoft Azure, which likely provided access to large amounts of data and computing resources for the training process. However, no specific datasets were mentioned in the context, so it's unclear what types of text data were used during training.",1.0,0.0
"How does GPT-4.5 perform across different languages?","['The model was tested on the MMLU test set in 15 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba.[5]']", "Based on the additional context provided, it is clear that GPT-4.5 has been tested on a diverse range of languages, including Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. While the existing answer mentions that GPT-4.5 outperforms its predecessor model, GPT-4o, in these languages, it doesn't provide specific details about the extent of this improvement.<br><br>However, the fact that GPT-4.5 is significantly more expensive to use than GPT-4o suggests that it may offer more advanced language generation capabilities. The high cost could be a result of the model's larger size and greater complexity, which allows it to better understand and generate responses in multiple languages.<br><br>Overall, while we don't have enough information to fully evaluate the differences between GPT-4.5 and GPT-4o in these languages, the fact that OpenAI is making the model available through its API for Plus and Pro users suggests that it offers significant improvements over its predecessor. As more researchers and developers begin using GPT-4.5, we may see new applications and benefits emerge, such as more accurate machine translation or better natural language processing for tasks like sentiment analysis or question answering in these languages.",0.7142857142857143,0.0

This is significantly higher than the costs for its predecessor model, GPT-4o, which only costs $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens. It's important to note that OpenAI announced in April 2025 that they will be phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1. This decision may impact the usage costs for these models in the future, but as of now, the costs for GPT-4.5 remain at $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens.",0.8333333333333334,0.9838045915646543
