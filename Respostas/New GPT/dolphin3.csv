What is GPT-4.5?,"Based on the provided context information, it appears that GPT-4.5 is a version of the language model developed by OpenAI. It was released in February 2025 and can be accessed by Plus and Pro users through the model picker on web, mobile, and desktop. However, according to Cade Metz of The New York Times, this version may not generate as much excitement as previous versions due to its limited capabilities compared to other models."
What training methods were used for GPT-4.5?,"Based on the provided context information, it is mentioned that GPT-4.5 was primarily trained using unsupervised learning, which improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning. This method was combined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. It was trained using Microsoft Azure.

The additional context provided does not offer any new information about the training methods used for GPT-4.5. Therefore, the original answer remains unchanged:

GPT-4.5 was primarily trained using unsupervised learning, combined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. It was trained using Microsoft Azure."
How does GPT-4.5 perform across different languages?,"GPT-4.5 is a large language model that can understand and generate text across 15 different languages, including Arabic, Spanish, French, Korean, Hebrew, Hungarian, Japanese, and Chinese. It was released on February 27, 2025, and has strong capabilities in understanding and generating text across these languages.

The model was tested on the MMLU test set, which tested 15 different languages, namely Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. The results showed that GPT-4.5 performed well across all these languages, demonstrating its ability to handle multilingual tasks effectively.

In terms of cost, Sam Altman described GPT-4.5 as a ""giant, expensive model"". As of February 2025, through OpenAI's API it costs $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens, whereas GPT-4o only costs $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens.

Overall, GPT-4.5 is a powerful language model that can handle multilingual tasks across various languages effectively."
What are the API usage costs for GPT-4.5?,"As of February 2025, GPT-4.5 costs $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens for OpenAI's API users. However, in April 2025, OpenAI announced that it was phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1."
Did GPT-4.5 pass the Turing Test?,"Yes, according to the pre-print study in March 2025, GPT-4.5 passed the Turing Test. The model was tested on the MMLU test set, which tested 15 different languages, namely Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba."
How was GPT-4.5 received by the media?,"Based on the provided context information, it can be inferred that GPT-4.5 was well-received by the media as it passed the Turing Test in a pre-print study in March 2025 and was considered an advanced language model at the time. However, OpenAI decided to phase out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1 in April 2025, which may have led to mixed reactions from the media regarding its significance and relevance.

Additionally, some outlets like TechCrunch covered the release with excitement, while others such as The Verge and Axios provided more vague coverage. This mixed reception could be attributed to the fact that GPT-4 was considered more exciting than GPT-4.5 due to its capabilities.

Cade Metz of The New York Times stated that the model ""signifies the end of an era"" and was ""unlikely to generate as much excitement as GPT-4."" This suggests that while GPT-4.5 was still well-received, it may not have been seen as groundbreaking or significant compared to its successor."
How many languages were tested on MMLU test?,"15 different languages were tested on the MMLU test set. These include Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba."
Where can the model be accessed?,"Based on the provided context, it seems like there is a mention of GPT-4.5, but no specific details about where it can be accessed are given. However, if you're referring to accessing GPT-4.5 or similar advanced language models, typically they would be accessible through cloud-based AI platforms such as Alibaba Cloud, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or other providers that offer AI and machine learning services."
The model can't recognize pattern?,"Based on the provided context information, it seems that there is a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) models and their capabilities in recognizing patterns. Some of the mentioned individuals and systems are known for their contributions to AI research, such as Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Marvin Minsky, and Geoffrey Hinton, who have made significant advancements in pattern recognition.

Additionally, researchers like John Hopfield, Yoshua Bengio, Lotfi A. Zadeh, Stephen Grossberg, Alex Graves, Andrew Ng, Fei-Fei Li, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Demis Hassabis, David Silver, Ian Goodfellow, Andrej Karpathy, James Goodnight, and the architectures they have developed such as Neural Turing machine, Differentiable neural computer, Transformer, Vision transformer (ViT), Recurrent neural network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated recurrent unit (GRU), Echo state network, Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual neural network (ResNet), Highway, have also played a significant role in the development of AI models capable of recognizing patterns.

Furthermore, the new context includes various techniques and applications related to pattern recognition, such as SARSA, Imitation Policy gradient, Diffusion Latent diffusion model, Autoregression, Adversary RAG, Uncanny valley, RLHF, Self-supervised learning, Recursive self-improvement, Word embedding, Hallucination, Machine learning, In-context learning, Artificial neural network, Deep learning, Language model, Large language model, NMT, Artificial general intelligence (AGI), Implementations, Audioâ€“visual, AlexNet, WaveNet, Human image synthesis, HWR OCR, Speech synthesis, 15.ai, ElevenLabs, Speech recognition, Whisper, Facial, among others.

Therefore, it can be inferred that these models and researchers are focused on developing AI systems capable of recognizing patterns."
What Sam Altman said about the GPT-4.5?,"Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has stated that GPT-4.5 is a significant improvement over its predecessor, GPT-4. He mentioned that it has better performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making it more capable of handling complex tasks such as language translation, content creation, and problem-solving. Additionally, Altman emphasized the potential impact of GPT-4.5 on various industries, including healthcare, education, and technology, by enabling machines to think and reason like humans.

In further context, GPT-4.5 outperformed its predecessors in multiple languages such as Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. A pre-print study in March 2025 found that GPT-4.5 passed the Turing Test. However, in April 2025, OpenAI announced that it was phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1.

The release of GPT-4.5 generated significant attention and coverage from various media outlets, including TechCrunch and The Verge. Despite its impressive capabilities, some sources noted that it may not generate as much excitement as GPT-4 due to the incremental nature of its improvements."
