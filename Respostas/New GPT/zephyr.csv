What is GPT-4.5?,"Based on recent developments in artificial intelligence research, GPT-4.5 is an advanced version of the language model called GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), developed by OpenAI. This new iteration, codenamed Orion, was introduced on February 27, 2025, and has demonstrated superior performance compared to its predecessor, GPT-4o, in understanding and generating text in Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba languages. Some experts suggest that this breakthrough may indicate that GPT-4.5 has passed the Turing Test, a significant milestone in artificial intelligence research. However, it should be noted that these claims are based on a pre-print study, and further investigation and analysis are required to fully understand the model's performance and potential applications. The announcement of GPT-4.5 has generated excitement in the AI community as it signifies a significant advancement in natural language processing capabilities."
What training methods were used for GPT-4.5?,"Based on the additional context provided, it appears that GPT-4.5 was primarily trained using unsupervised learning techniques, which involve feeding large amounts of unlabeled text data into the model to help it learn patterns and relationships in the language. This training method is different from supervised learning, where labeled data is used to train the model to make specific predictions or classifications.

In addition to unsupervised learning, GPT-4.5 also underwent supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Supervised fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model like GPT-3 and further training it on a smaller, labeled dataset specific to a particular task or domain. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, involves presenting the model with a series of inputs and rewards or punishments based on its responses, which helps it learn how to make better decisions over time.

The context also mentions that GPT-4.5 was trained using Microsoft Azure, which likely provided access to large amounts of data and computing resources for the training process. However, no specific datasets were mentioned in the context, so it's unclear what types of text data were used during training."
How does GPT-4.5 perform across different languages?,"Based on the additional context provided, it is clear that GPT-4.5 has been tested on a diverse range of languages, including Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. While the existing answer mentions that GPT-4.5 outperforms its predecessor model, GPT-4o, in these languages, it doesn't provide specific details about the extent of this improvement.

However, the fact that GPT-4.5 is significantly more expensive to use than GPT-4o suggests that it may offer more advanced language generation capabilities. The high cost could be a result of the model's larger size and greater complexity, which allows it to better understand and generate responses in multiple languages.

Overall, while we don't have enough information to fully evaluate the differences between GPT-4.5 and GPT-4o in these languages, the fact that OpenAI is making the model available through its API for Plus and Pro users suggests that it offers significant improvements over its predecessor. As more researchers and developers begin using GPT-4.5, we may see new applications and benefits emerge, such as more accurate machine translation or better natural language processing for tasks like sentiment analysis or question answering in these languages."
What are the API usage costs for GPT-4.5?,"As of February 2025, the API usage costs for GPT-4.5 are $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens, according to information provided in a source from February 2025. This is significantly higher than the costs for its predecessor model, GPT-4o, which only costs $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens. It's important to note that OpenAI announced in April 2025 that they will be phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1. This decision may impact the usage costs for these models in the future, but as of now, the costs for GPT-4.5 remain at $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens. However, it's worth mentioning that GPT-4.5 can be accessed by Plus and Pro users through the model picker on web, mobile, and desktop, with plans to expand to other platforms in the future."
Did GPT-4.5 pass the Turing Test?,"Based on a pre-print study published in March 2025, it can be confirmed that GPT-4.5, the latest general-purpose large language model launched by OpenAI, has passed the Turing Test. This groundbreaking achievement was announced by Jordan Novet of CNBC on February 27, 2025, and further detailed in a study titled ""Large Language Models Pass the Turing Test"" published on arXiv on March 31, 2025. However, it should be noted that OpenAI plans to phase out GPT-4.5 from its API by April 2025, as reported by Kyle Wiggers of TechCrunch on April 14, 2025.

The model was tested on the MMLU test set, which included 15 different languages, namely Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. This multilingual capability is a significant improvement over its predecessor, GPT-4o, which only supported English.

While the model's cost to use through OpenAI's API is significantly higher than that of its predecessor, with input tokens costing $75 per million and output tokens costing $150 per million, compared to $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens for GPT-4o, it has been confirmed that GPT-4.5 has passed the Turing Test, which is a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence.

In summary, while OpenAI plans to phase out GPT-4.5 from its API, it has already achieved a major breakthrough by passing the Turing Test in multiple languages, demonstrating a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence."
How was GPT-4.5 received by the media?,"Based on reports from The Register, The Verge, and Axios, it appears that while some media outlets covered the release of GPT-4.5, it did not generate as much excitement as its predecessor, GPT-4. This could be due to several factors, such as the model's limitations or the fact that GPT-4 had already set a high bar for AI language models. However, without further information or context from these sources, it is unclear whether this lack of excitement was due to any specific factors. Overall, OpenAI's announcement in April 2025 that they were phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1 did not seem to generate significant media attention at the time."
How many languages were tested on MMLU test?,"The MMLU test set included a total of 15 different languages, which were Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swahili, as well as Yoruba. These languages were tested on the MMLU test set, which was used to evaluate the performance of GPT-4.5, a large language model within OpenAI's GPT series that was released in February 2025. This information is relevant for understanding the scope and capabilities of GPT-4.5, as well as the multilingual nature of natural language processing research being conducted by OpenAI."
