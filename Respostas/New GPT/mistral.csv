What is GPT-4.5?," Based on the provided additional context, it appears that GPT-4.5 is a large language model developed by OpenAI, codenamed Orion. It was released on February 27, 2025, and can be accessed by Plus and Pro users through the model picker on web, mobile, and desktop. The model is available in 15 languages, and there are plans to expand its availability to other platforms. According to Cade Metz of The New York Times, the release of GPT-4.5 signifies the end of an era and was unlikely to generate as much excitement as its predecessor, GPT-3.5. It passed the Turing Test in a pre-print study in March 2025 and was later phased out from API access in favor of GPT-4.1 in April 2025. However, without more context or additional information, it's not possible to provide a more detailed answer about what GPT-4.5 is or its specific capabilities beyond what has been mentioned."
What training methods were used for GPT-4.5?," The provided context suggests that GPT-4.5 is a large language model within OpenAI's GPT series, introduced on February 27, 2025. It was primarily trained using a combination of unsupervised learning, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback. This training approach allows the model to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without explicit reasoning, while also being refined based on human feedback. The model can be accessed by Plus and Pro users through the model picker on web, mobile, and desktop, with plans to expand its availability to other platforms in the future. It's important to note that GPT-4.5 was trained using Microsoft Azure."
How does GPT-4.5 perform across different languages?," Given the additional context, we can refine the original answer as follows: According to the provided context, GPT-4.5 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that was released on February 27, 2025. It can be accessed by Plus and Pro users through the model picker on web, mobile, and desktop. A study conducted in March 2025 tested GPT-4.5 on the MMLU test set, which includes 15 different languages: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. The study suggests that GPT-4.5 outperforms GPT-4o across these 15 languages. It's important to note that the performance of these models may have changed since then, and the context does not provide specific details about the criteria used to determine ""outperforming"" or the scope of the comparison between GPT-4.5 and GPT-4o. Additionally, as of February 2025, through OpenAI's API, GPT-4.5 costs $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens, whereas GPT-4o only costs $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens."
What are the API usage costs for GPT-4.5?," Given the new context, it appears that GPT-4.5 was a large language model developed by OpenAI and released on February 27, 2025. However, as of now, GPT-4.5 is no longer accessible through API access due to its replacement by GPT-4.1 in April 2025. For current pricing information on OpenAI's models, please refer to their official website or documentation."
Did GPT-4.5 pass the Turing Test?," Based on the provided sources, it appears that GPT-4.5 was claimed to have passed the Turing Test according to a pre-print study published on March 31, 2025 (arXiv:2503.23674). However, it's important to note that OpenAI announced plans to phase out GPT-4.5 from its API by April 14, 2025 (TechCrunch). The model was tested on the MMLU test set, which included 15 different languages: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. Despite passing the Turing Test, GPT-4.5 was considered a ""giant, expensive model"" by Sam Altman, with costs per million input and output tokens significantly higher than its successor, GPT-4o, through OpenAI's API as of February 2025."
How was GPT-4.5 received by the media?," Based on the provided context, it appears that GPT-4.5 received a mixed response from the media. While some outlets like The Verge and Axios covered its release without indicating a high level of excitement, Cade Metz of The New York Times described the model as ""signifying the end of an era"" and suggested it was unlikely to generate as much excitement as its predecessor, GPT-4. However, without specific quotes or direct statements from these outlets about their feelings towards the release, it is difficult to definitively say how they felt about the release. The context also indicates that more information may be available in news articles published in April 2025."
How many languages were tested on MMLU test?,"15 languages were tested on the MMLU test set in 2025 as part of the GPT-4.5 model developed by OpenAI. The languages included Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and Yoruba. This information is based on the release of the large language model, ChatGPT, in 2025."
Where can the model be accessed?," Based on the provided context, it appears that GPT-4.5 (also known as Orion) can be accessed by Plus and Pro users through the model picker on web, mobile, and desktop. The release of this model was covered by various outlets such as TechCrunch, The Verge, and Axios. However, it is not specified whether plans to expand access to other users or platforms will be implemented in the future."
The model can't recognize pattern?," Based on the expanded context provided, it appears that none of the mentioned concepts or models in AI and machine learning are directly associated with an AI model that ""can't recognize patterns."" However, some of these concepts like SARSA Imitation Policy gradient, Diffusion Latent diffusion model, Autoregression, Adversary RAG, Self-supervised learning, Recursive self-improvement, Word embedding, and Language models are designed to learn and recognize patterns from data. Additionally, specific implementations such as AlexNet, WaveNet, Human image synthesis, HWR OCR, Speech synthesis, 15.ai ElevenLabs, Whisper, Facial, and Speech recognition are also used for pattern recognition tasks in various domains like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. If you're referring to a specific AI model or situation where pattern recognition is an issue, it might be helpful to clarify the question or provide more context."
What Sam Altman said about the GPT-4.5?," With the provided additional context, it appears that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, did not specifically comment about GPT-4.5 in the provided sources. However, it is mentioned that other outlets such as The Verge and Axios covered the model's release, which suggests that there might have been excitement surrounding its launch, but not necessarily about GPT-4.5 specifically."
