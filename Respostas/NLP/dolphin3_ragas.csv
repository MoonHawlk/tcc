It involves various tasks such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, machine translation, speech recognition, and more. NLP aims to make computers capable of understanding and processing natural language data in a way that is similar to how humans do.

NLP is closely related to information retrieval, knowledge representation, and computational linguistics, which are subfields of linguistics. Major tasks in natural language processing include speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation. The history of NLP dates back to the 1950s, with significant advancements made over the years.

The context provided adds depth to the understanding of NLP by mentioning cognitive science and cognitive linguistics. It explains how the theory of conceptual metaphor can be applied in NLP algorithms to understand the intent behind words or phrases used in comparisons. This further emphasizes the complexity and nuance involved in processing human language, as computers must not only recognize patterns but also interpret meaning in a way that is similar to human cognition.

In summary, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an AI subfield focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language through various tasks like text analysis, sentiment analysis, machine translation, speech recognition, etc. It aims to make computers process natural language data similarly to humans.

3. Named entity recognition: Identifying and categorizing named entities in text.
4. Text classification: Categorizing text into predefined categories.
5. Question answering: Answering questions based on the content of a given text.

These applications often involve higher-level NLP techniques such as representation learning and end-to-end systems, which have evolved from rule-based methods to more advanced weakly supervised approaches.
