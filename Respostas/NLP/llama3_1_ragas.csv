Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language, closely related to information retrieval, knowledge representation, and computational linguistics. It enables tasks such as speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.

The underlying principles of NLP are rooted in cognitive science and cognitive linguistics, which provide a deeper understanding of how humans process and understand language. Specifically, the theory of conceptual metaphor, which involves understanding one idea in terms of another (e.g., ""That is a big tree"" implies physical largeness), informs the development of NLP algorithms and their ability to capture nuances of human language.

	* Lexical semantics: word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling
	* Relational semantics: dependency parsing, semantic parsing
	* Discourse: coreference resolution, text summarization)
4. Natural-language generation (which can include tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering)

The Lesk algorithm is an algorithm used for word sense disambiguation in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It was developed by Michael J. Lesk in 1986 as a method to resolve polysemy, where a single word has multiple related meanings. The algorithm focuses on semantics and uses dictionary definitions to identify the most likely meaning of a word in context.

The significance of the Turing test in the context of NLP lies in its proposal of a criterion for measuring intelligence through automated interpretation and generation of natural language. This laid the groundwork for symbolic NLP, which focuses on computational manipulation of symbols to represent meaning in human language. However, as cognitive linguistics and the theory of conceptual metaphor suggest, understanding language is not just about manipulating symbols, but also about grasping the underlying concepts and intentions behind them.

The Turing test's influence can be seen in various NLP subfields, including machine translation, question answering, and dialogue systems. Yet, its limitations are evident in the Georgetown experiment's early successes followed by apparent limitations, as well as John Searle's Chinese room experiment highlighting superficial understanding rather than true comprehension. Despite these challenges, the Turing test remains a significant milestone in NLP research, sparking decades-long pursuit of developing more sophisticated and human-like language processing capabilities.

I incorporated some key points from the new context:

* The theory of conceptual metaphor, which highlights the importance of understanding the underlying concepts and intentions behind language.
* Cognitive linguistics, which provides a framework for analyzing language through its cognitive and conceptual aspects.

The introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing led to a ""revolution"" in natural language processing (NLP).

The 1990s saw notable early successes in statistical methods in NLP, particularly in machine translation, with work at IBM Research contributing significantly through the development of alignment models.

However, it wasn't until the early 2010s that deep learning techniques began to gain traction in NLP, as evident from Richard Socher's ACL 2012 tutorial on ""Deep Learning For NLP"".
