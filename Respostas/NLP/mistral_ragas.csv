4. Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone behind words to understand attitudes, opinions, and emotions. This is commonly used in social media monitoring and customer service.

5. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and categorizing named entities in text, such as people, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

6. Question Answering Systems: Automatically answering questions based on a given text or database, like Google's search engine or chatbots.

7. Text Classification: Categorizing text into different groups, such as spam filtering in email systems or content moderation on social media platforms.

9. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Interactive systems designed to convincingly simulate conversation with human users, such as customer service chatbots or personal assistants like Cortana or Bixby.

10. Language Learning Tools: Using NLP techniques to help people learn new languages, like Duolingo or Rosetta Stone.

In addition, NLP focuses on understanding the semantics of individual words (lexical semantics), sentences (relational semantics), and discourse beyond individual sentences. These areas are crucial for higher-level NLP applications such as:

* Dialogue systems that can maintain a coherent conversation with users over multiple turns, understanding the context and building on previous exchanges.
* Text generation systems that can write coherent and engaging text in various styles and tones, from creative writing to news articles or academic papers.
* Legal and medical NLP applications that can analyze complex documents and extract relevant information for decision-making purposes.

In the field of medicine and healthcare, NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care or protect patient privacy. This is increasingly important as language modeling and parsing become more sophisticated.
