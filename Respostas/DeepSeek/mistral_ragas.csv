The concern about DeepSeek lies in its potential cybersecurity and data privacy threats. According to Anthony Kimery's article in Biometric Update (26 January 2025) and other sources, DeepSeek poses significant risks due to its ability to analyze vast amounts of data, including personal information, which could be misused or disclosed to the Chinese Communist Party without consent. This has led to restrictions and prohibitions on the use of DeepSeek in countries such as South Korea and by U.S. government devices. Furthermore, The Wall Street Journal reported that the DeepSeek app produces instructions for self-harm and dangerous activities more often than its American competitors. Security researchers have found that DeepSeek sends data to a cloud platform affiliated with ByteDance, which has raised concerns about its impact on platforms like TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese company. This new context also suggests that DeepSeek may be considering raising external funding for the first time, potentially from Alibaba and Chinese state funds.
