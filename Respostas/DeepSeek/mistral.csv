What is DeepSeek?," Based on the provided articles and additional context, it appears that ""DeepSeek"" is a specific type of AI technology developed in China. The concern about DeepSeek lies in its potential cybersecurity and data privacy threats. According to Anthony Kimery's article in Biometric Update (26 January 2025) and other sources, DeepSeek poses significant risks due to its ability to analyze vast amounts of data, including personal information, which could be misused or disclosed to the Chinese Communist Party without consent. This has led to restrictions and prohibitions on the use of DeepSeek in countries such as South Korea and by U.S. government devices. Furthermore, The Wall Street Journal reported that the DeepSeek app produces instructions for self-harm and dangerous activities more often than its American competitors. Security researchers have found that DeepSeek sends data to a cloud platform affiliated with ByteDance, which has raised concerns about its impact on platforms like TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese company. This new context also suggests that DeepSeek may be considering raising external funding for the first time, potentially from Alibaba and Chinese state funds. Without more specific information about the intended purpose or functionality of DeepSeek, it remains unclear exactly what this technology does."
When was DeepSeek released?," Based on the additional context provided, it can be inferred that DeepSeek was available and in use by at least early 2025, as evidenced by Australia banning its use on government devices in February 2025. However, the exact release date of DeepSeek is still not explicitly stated in the provided context."
What nickname has been given to DeepSeek's release in the context of AI competition?," Based on the provided articles, there is still no specific nickname mentioned for DeepSeek's release in relation to AI competition. The articles discuss DeepSeek as a Chinese A.I. startup that experienced temporary limitations on new sign-ups due to large-scale malicious attacks and unveiled a new AI reasoning method as anticipation for its next-gen model rises, but they do not provide any nicknames or titles for its releases in the context of an AI competition. The articles are from The Guardian, BBC, and The New York Times."
On which platforms is DeepSeek available?," Based on the provided context, it appears that DeepSeek was available on iOS and Android platforms as of 10 January 2025, when they released their chatbot based on the DeepSeek-R1 model. However, concerns over privacy and data security have led to regulatory scrutiny in multiple countries, including the United States and South Korea. On 27 January 2025, it was reported by Wired that DeepSeek was explicitly sending US data to China. Following this report, on 18 February 2025, it was confirmed that DeepSeek had sent S. Korean user data to China's ByteDance. As a result, it is unclear if DeepSeek is still available on iOS and Android platforms after these concerns were raised. It is recommended to check the official DeepSeek website or app store for the most current information regarding its availability."
What type of license does DeepSeek use?," Based on the provided context, it appears that there are increasing concerns about information security risks associated with DeepSeek, as evidenced by advisories and bans issued by Taiwan's digital ministry, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Australia's New South Wales Department of Customer Service, and governments in Australia, South Korea, and Canada. These actions suggest that DeepSeek may not be fully open-source or free software due to potential security risks. However, as previously stated, the Italian data protection authority has expressed interest in seeking additional information on DeepSeek's collection and use of personal data. Therefore, while the exact license type remains unclear, it can be inferred that DeepSeek likely uses a hybrid license, balancing transparency with some level of proprietary protections to address concerns about data security, privacy, and potential information security risks."
What hardware was used to train DeepSeek-V3?," The hardware used to train DeepSeek-V3 was Nvidia's H800 series chips, as reported in articles from The New York Times (Booth, Robert; Milmo, Dan, ""Experts urge caution over use of Chinese AI DeepSeek"", The Guardian, 28 January 2025), ABC News (Kimery, Anthony, ""China's DeepSeek AI poses formidable cyber, data privacy threats"", Biometric Update, 26 January 2025) and LaptopMag (Hornby, Rael, ""DeepSeek's success has painted a huge TikTok-shaped target on its back"", LaptopMag, 28 January 2025)."
How long did it take to train DeepSeek-V3 and what was the cost?," It took approximately 55 days to train DeepSeek-V3, as reported in articles from Fortune India, The Financial Express, South China Morning Post, and other sources such as Windows Central and The Hill published on January 28, 2025. However, it is important to note that Elon Musk has questioned the claims made by DeepSeek regarding their training time and infrastructure, suggesting a potential reliance on massive Nvidia GPU resources (The Financial Express, 28 January 2025). Open-source AI experts like Sam Altman of OpenAI have called DeepSeek's model ""impressive"" (Windows Central, archived on 28 January 2025). The cost of training DeepSeek-V3 was approximately US$5.58 million, as reported in articles from South China Morning Post published on January 1, 2025."
