What is DeepSeek?,"DeepSeek is a software tool developed by Baidu that enables advanced search and analysis of large-scale scientific datasets. However, due to concerns over personal information misuse and potential disclosure of sensitive data with the Chinese Communist Party, it has been banned on government devices in both the United States and South Korea as a precautionary measure. Experts have urged caution over the use of DeepSeek due to its success potentially making it a target for cyber threats, particularly given China's increasing dominance in AI and the popularity of Chinese-owned apps like TikTok. These concerns have been highlighted by reports that DeepSeek's code contains backdoors that could be exploited by the Chinese government or other malicious actors. Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reported that the DeepSeek app produces instructions for self-harm and dangerous activities more often than its American competitors. Security researchers have also found that DeepSeek sends data to a cloud platform affiliated with ByteDance. In February 2025, sources claimed that DeepSeek began considering raising external funding for the first time, with Alibaba and Chinese state funds potentially involved."
When was DeepSeek released?,"Unfortunately, the provided context still does not offer any information regarding when DeepSeek was initially released. The given news articles only report on actions taken against DeepSeek in response to security concerns, but do not provide a release date for the software. Therefore, our original answer still stands that it is unknown when DeepSeek was released based on the provided context alone."
What nickname has been given to DeepSeek's release in the context of AI competition?,"Based on the additional context provided, it still does not appear that a nickname has been given to DeepSeek's release in the context of AI competition. The articles provided focus mainly on DeepSeek's success as an AI chatbot and its temporary limitation of new sign-ups due to ""large-scale malicious attacks."" While one article from The Guardian mentions DeepSeek unveiling a new AI reasoning method, it does not mention anything about the release being in the context of an AI competition. Therefore, we must return the original answer that there is no information provided regarding a nickname for DeepSeek's release in the context of AI competition.

However, if you're asking whether DeepSeek has participated in any AI competitions and won any awards or titles, the articles provided do not offer any such information either."
On which platforms is DeepSeek available?,"Based on recent developments and regulatory scrutiny, it is currently known that DeepSeek's chatbot is available for download on iOS and Android devices as of January 10, 2025. However, concerns over privacy and information control have led to restrictions or prohibitions in certain countries due to misuse and disclosure of personal information and proprietary data. It's unclear if DeepSeek is available on any other platforms beyond iOS and Android devices at this time. Further research may be necessary to determine the full extent of its availability.

What type of license does DeepSeek use?,"Unfortunately, the provided context does not offer any further insight into the specific type of open-source license used by DeepSeek. However, the fact that several governments have raised concerns about data security and personal information misuse in relation to DeepSeek highlights the importance of transparency and adherence to data protection laws when developing and releasing open-source software like DeepSeek. This underscores the need for careful consideration of the license used, as it can impact how the software is shared, modified, and distributed by other developers and organizations. Ultimately, the specific type of open-source license used by DeepSeek may depend on a variety of factors, including its intended use, the nature of the data it processes, and the preferences of its developers and funders. As for the recent bans on using DeepSeek in government devices, these actions suggest that some governments are taking a cautious approach to the use of this technology due to concerns about information security risks."
What hardware was used to train DeepSeek-V3?,"Despite using fewer resources than leading AI companies, DeepSeek-V3, the chatbot developed by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, was still trained with approximately 2,000 Nvidia H800 series GPUs, according to a report by The New York Times. This is significantly fewer than the as many as 16,000 GPUs used by leading AI companies to train their chatbots with supercomputers (Metz & Tobin, 2025; Zahn, 2025). This information has raised concerns from experts regarding the cyber and data privacy threats posed by DeepSeek's success, as reported by Anthony Kimery in Biometric Update (Kimery, 2025). Additionally, Robert Booth and Dan Milmo of The Guardian have urged caution over the use of DeepSeek due to these concerns (Booth & Milmo, 2025). Rael Hornby of LaptopMag has also highlighted that DeepSeek's success has painted a huge TikTok-shaped target on its back (Hornby, 2025)."
How long did it take to train DeepSeek-V3 and what was the cost?,"In response to Elon Musk's skepticism about DeepSeek's claims regarding the cost and time required for training their latest model, DeepSeek has stood by their statements. According to reports in Fortune India and the South China Morning Post, DeepSeek trained its DeepSeek-V3 model in approximately 55 days at a cost of around $5.58 million. This information has also been acknowledged by other industry experts such as Miranda Nazzaro from The Hill and Eugene Kim from CNBC. Notably, OpenAI's Sam Altman has called DeepSeek's model ""impressive"". While Musk has raised doubts about the necessity of such massive Nvidia GPU infrastructure for training AI models, DeepSeek's disruption in the field of AI model training is being widely recognized by major AWS customers like Stripe and Toyota who are demanding access to AWS services."
What significant event occurred on January 27 2025 related to DeepSeek?,"Unfortunately, based on the additional context provided, there is still no specific event related to DeepSeek mentioned in any article published on January 27, 2025. The articles only report on developments surrounding DeepSeek in February of that year and do not provide any new information about a significant event occurring on January 27th. Therefore, we must return the original answer that there is no specific event related to DeepSeek mentioned in any article published on January 27, 2025."
What measures did DeepSeek take following a cyberattack on January 27 2025?,"Based on the additional context provided, it is clear that DeepSeek did not take any measures following a cyberattack on January 27, 2025. Instead, concerns were raised about DeepSeek's data security practices and potential regulatory action due to the exposure of personal information from EU and US residents, as well as over a million South Koreans being transferred to China without proper consent or protection. It is unclear if DeepSeek faced any immediate risks during this incident, but it did occur more than an hour before the exposure was discovered. Therefore, we must assume that no specific measures were taken by DeepSeek following a cyberattack on January 27, 2025."
What collaboration did DeepSeek engage in on April 3 2025?,"Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is still no information about any collaboration DeepSeek engaged in on April 3, 2025. The sources only discuss DeepSeek's potential funding from Alibaba and Chinese state funds, as well as its involvement in OpenSourceWeek, which took place from February 21-27, 2025. However, without any further details or announcements from DeepSeek, it is unclear if any significant collaborations occurred during this timeframe.

In light of the new context, it's worth mentioning that in January 2025, experts raised concerns about the potential cyber and data privacy threats posed by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company. The Guardian reported that some experts urged caution over the use of DeepSeek due to its close ties with the Chinese government and military. Additionally, LaptopMag noted that DeepSeek's success had painted a huge TikTok-shaped target on its back, potentially making it a target for cyber attacks. However, without any further information or announcements from DeepSeek, it remains unclear if the company engaged in any significant collaborations during April 3, 2025, or at any other time."
