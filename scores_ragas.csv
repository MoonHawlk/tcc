Therefore, the primary biome found in northeastern Brazil is primarily the Amazon Rainforest. Furthermore, it's important to note that Brazil ranks high among countries with the most known species of plants, freshwater fish, mammals, birds, and reptiles, making it one of the world's richest regions in terms of biodiversity.",0.8333333333333334,0.9595557292034647
