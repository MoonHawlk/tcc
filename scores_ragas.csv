However, it should be noted that this information is not from a peer-reviewed study and the model's ability to pass the Turing Test has only been reported in an unpublished study as of March 2025.

Unfortunately, OpenAI announced in April 2025 that they will be phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of a newer version called GPT-4.1. This suggests that GPT-4.5 may no longer be available for use by the public through OpenAI's platform, and developers should consider migrating to the newer model instead.

As this information is still developing, it's important to verify any claims about GPT-4.5 with reliable sources before relying on them. The article mentioned in the context above could potentially provide more details and insights into the capabilities of GPT-4.5, but further research would be necessary to confirm its accuracy.

In summary, while GPT-4.5 appears to be a promising advancement in natural language processing, its availability for public use may be limited due to OpenAI's decision to phase it out. Developers should stay informed about any updates or announcements from OpenAI regarding the future of their language models.
